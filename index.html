          <h3>Qualitative Research</h3>
          <p>
            My passion as a qualitative researcher is to go to the heart of human experience. As a formally trained anthropologist, I use qualitative methods to collect and analyze data that describes and explains the complexities that make up everyday life and the exceptional moments that periodically punctate it. I have a depth of experience conducting ethnographic fieldwork, including independent and collaborative projects in France, Colombia, and the United States. I am at ease undertaking participant observation, conducting interviews, leading focus groups, developing and administering questionnaires and surveys, as well as performing primary and secondary source research. Thanks to my French fluency and advanced Spanish proficiency, I am able to develop a broad field of inquiry and ensure that my work captures the nuances of cultural diversity.

          <h3>Quantitative Research</h3>
          <p>
            As a quantitative researcher, I use mathematical models to analyze data, create stories and visualizations, and develop frameworks for proposing actionable recommendations based on my findings. I am comfortable employing a variety of Python libraries including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to make sense of data and guide problem-solving. With machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras I am able to develop predictive models that categorize, classify, uncover trends, and aid in the decision making process. I can take datasets through the whole analytical workflow, from framing the problem, collecting data, cleaning and processing data, performing visual and quantitative analyses, and communicating the results of my analysis.

        <p>
          I have a background in education and research. I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology from the University of Mary Washington (Fredericksburg, Virginia) and a Masters in Anthropology from the Universit√© de Toulouse (Toulouse, France). I began coding as a hobby, but Python has since grown into a tool that I deploy in support of my social science research. In my free time, I continue deepening my understanding of Python, statistics, data analysis and visualization, and machine learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a researcher, I have focused on the relationship between humans and their environments, with a particular interest in how space is created and managed to influence persons and their particular form of life. Much of my research has been centered on Western Europe and Latin America, where I have conducted ethnographic fieldwork. Regionally, I am also interested in francophone Africa, especially West Africa and the Maghreb. I have worked on and hope to continue exploring topics related to political and economic anthropology, interethnic relations, globalization, urban dynamics, technology, and environmental anthropology.
